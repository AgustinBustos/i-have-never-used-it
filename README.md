# Selenium Practice

In this proyect i learn the basics of the Selenium library. To clarify, i have never used it, but in order to keep it interesting, i went to the DiTella Gateway site and made a bot that automates the job serch based on some conditions, in the future i have to improve on the conditionals of the search (avoiding enterprise repetitions, job description understanding with machine learning).

After NOT using it, i immediately got 2 replies, i mean, it is a very interesting tool for curriculum evaluation, maybe in the future i will create an statictical test to evaluate mi CV performance.
